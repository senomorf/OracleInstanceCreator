# Disable SC1091 - we know our sourced files exist

# Allow unquoted variables in specific contexts we control
# disable=SC2086 - will fix these individually
# Allow local assignment patterns that are commonly used
# disable=SC2155 - will fix these individually

# Suppress SC2034 (unused variables) for constants.sh as these are for external use  
# Suppress SC2329 (unused functions) in test files as they're called by test frameworks
# Note: file-specific suppressions require different approach - using global disable for now
