# ShellCheck configuration for OCI Automation Project
# See: https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# === GLOBAL SUPPRESSIONS ===
# Only suppress issues that are inherent to the project structure

# SC1091: Can't follow non-constant source - we control our sourcing patterns
# SC2086: Quote variables - TEMPORARY suppression until issue #50 resolved (~51 instances)
# SC2155: Declare/assign separately - TEMPORARY suppression until issue #50 resolved (~51 instances)
disable=SC1091,SC2086,SC2155

# === FUTURE WORK (Technical Debt) ===
# The following suppressions should be addressed individually:
# 
# SC2086 (Quote variables): ~51 instances - see issue #50
# - Most should be quoted: $var -> "$var" 
# - Some intentional word splitting cases need inline suppressions
# disable=SC2086
#
# SC2155 (Declare/assign separately): ~51 instances - see issue #50  
# - Split: local var=$(cmd) -> local var; var=$(cmd)
# - Prevents masking command exit codes
# disable=SC2155

# === FILE-SPECIFIC SUPPRESSIONS NEEDED ===
# Global suppressions below should be migrated to file-specific - see issue #51
#
# SC2034: Unused variables (~101 instances)
# - constants.sh: Variables exported for external use
# - Should use: # shellcheck disable=SC2034 at file level
#
# SC2329: Unused functions (~101 instances)  
# - test files: Functions called by test frameworks
# - Should use inline suppressions per function

# Source path for external scripts
source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# === TEMPORARY GLOBAL SUPPRESSIONS ===
# TODO: Remove these after migrating to file-specific suppressions (issue #51)
# Suppress SC2034 (unused variables) for constants.sh exports
# Suppress SC2329 (unused functions) in test files called by frameworks
