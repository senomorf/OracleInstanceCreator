            Please review this pull request with comprehensive analysis covering both general software engineering principles and OCI automation specifics:

            **General Code Quality & Best Practices:**
            - Code structure, readability, and maintainability
            - Proper error handling and input validation
            - Logic bugs, edge cases, and null checks
            - Algorithm efficiency and resource usage
            - Documentation quality and code comments
            - Adherence to coding standards and conventions
            - Verify that README.md and docs are updated for any new features or config changes

            **Security Analysis (General & OCI-Specific):**
            - Input validation and injection vulnerabilities
            - Authentication and authorization patterns
            - **OCI Credential Safety**: Check for exposed credentials (OCI OCIDs, keys, SSH keys, tokens)
            - **Parameter redaction**: OCIDs should show as ocid1234...5678, keys as [REDACTED]
            - Verify secrets are only used in GitHub Actions, never in artifacts
            - Distinguish capacity issues from real security failures

            **Performance Considerations:**
            - Algorithm complexity and optimization opportunities
            - Memory usage and resource efficiency
            - **OCI Performance**: Target <1 minute execution time
            - **GitHub Actions**: Monitor usage to stay under 1,800 minutes/month target
            - Caching strategies and optimization patterns

            **Test Coverage & Quality:**
            - Test completeness and edge case coverage
            - Test quality, clarity, and maintainability
            - Integration test scenarios
            - Error condition testing

            **OCI-Specific Automation Patterns:**
            - Validate OCID format: ^ocid1\\.type\\.[a-z0-9-]*\\.[a-z0-9-]*\\..+
            - Check flexible shape configurations include --shape-config
            - Verify capacity errors return 0 (expected) vs 1 (real failure)
            - Confirm transient errors retry properly before AD cycling
            - Multi-AD cycling logic and retry mechanisms
            - Bash script validation and OCI CLI optimization

            **Potential Bugs & Issues:**
            - Race conditions and concurrency issues
            - Boundary conditions and error states
            - Configuration and environment dependencies
            - Workflow and automation reliability

            Be constructive, thorough, and provide specific actionable feedback.
            Use GitHub's suggestion format when proposing code changes.
            Use inline comments to highlight specific areas of concern.
