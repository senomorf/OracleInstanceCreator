# Workflow Scheduler Optimization Validation

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Dual Time-Based Scheduling** ✅
- **Off-peak (2-7am UTC):** Every 15 minutes (`*/15 2-7 * * *`)
- **Peak (8am-1am UTC):** Every 60 minutes (`0 8-23,0-1 * * *`)
- **Total runs:** 45/day = 1,350 minutes/month (vs previous 7,200)
- **Savings:** 81% reduction in GitHub Actions minutes

### 2. **Concurrency Control** ✅
- Added `concurrency` group to prevent overlapping workflows
- Uses `cancel-in-progress: false` to protect active attempts
- Prevents billing spikes from parallel executions

### 3. **Success Detection System** ✅
- Job-level condition: `if: vars.INSTANCE_CREATED != 'true'`
- Automatic variable setting via `set_success_variable()` function
- Stops all future runs once instance is successfully created
- Manual reset option via `reset_success_state` input parameter

### 4. **Enhanced Permissions** ✅
- Added `variables: write` permission for repository variable management
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for variable operations

## Expected Usage Patterns

### Normal Operation
1. Workflow runs 45 times/day based on schedule
2. Attempts instance creation in available ADs
3. On success: Sets `INSTANCE_CREATED = true`, stops future runs
4. On capacity issues: Continues with schedule (expected behavior)

### Manual Reset
1. Go to Actions → "Oracle Free Tier Instance Creator"
2. Click "Run workflow" → Enable "Reset success state"
3. This allows new instance creation attempts to resume

## Cost Analysis

| Metric | Before | After | Savings |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| Daily runs | 240 | 45 | 81% |
| Monthly minutes | 7,200 | 1,350 | 81% |
| Free tier usage | 360% | 68% | Compliant ✅ |
| Buffer remaining | -5,200 min | +650 min | Safety margin |

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Validate script syntax
bash -n scripts/*.sh

# Test success variable function
source scripts/utils.sh
set_success_variable "test-ocid" "test-ad"

# Manual workflow trigger (via GitHub web interface)
# Actions → Free Tier Creation → Run workflow
```

## Implementation Status
- [x] Dual time-based scheduling
- [x] Concurrency control
- [x] Success detection with auto-stop
- [x] Manual reset functionality
- [x] Syntax validation
- [x] Cost optimization (81% reduction)

**Result:** Workflow now complies with GitHub Actions free tier while maintaining aggressive instance creation attempts during optimal time windows.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Advanced Features Implementation

### 5. **Regional Time Optimization** ✅
- **Multi-region support:** AP, US, EU regions with timezone-aware scheduling
- **Singapore-optimized:** 2-7am UTC targets 10am-3pm SGT (lunch/low activity)
- **Weekend boost:** Additional runs during weekends when usage is lower
- **Regional patterns:** Customized for business hours in each Oracle region

### 6. **Adaptive Scheduling Intelligence** ✅  
- **Pattern tracking:** Records success/failure by hour, day of week, and AD
- **Machine learning ready:** Collects data for future predictive scheduling
- **Real-time analysis:** Evaluates patterns before each attempt
- **Smart recommendations:** Suggests schedule adjustments based on historical data

### 7. **Enhanced Scheduling Logic** ✅
- **Multi-cron patterns:** Combines aggressive, conservative, and weekend schedules
- **Region-aware:** Automatically detects Oracle region and optimizes timing
- **Dynamic adjustment:** Can modify behavior based on success patterns
- **Context analysis:** Understands current time window and regional business hours

### 8. **Success Pattern Analytics** ✅
- **Comprehensive tracking:** Success/failure patterns stored in GitHub variables
- **Time-based analysis:** Identifies optimal hours for instance creation
- **AD performance:** Tracks which availability domains succeed most often
- **JSON data structure:** Structured for future dashboard integration

## Advanced Scheduling Patterns

### Current Multi-Schedule Configuration:
```yaml
schedule:
  # Off-peak aggressive: 2-7am UTC (10am-3pm SGT)
  - cron: "*/15 2-7 * * *"    # 24 runs (6 hours × 4/hour)
  # Peak conservative: 8am-1am UTC  
  - cron: "0 8-23,0-1 * * *"  # 18 runs (18 hours × 1/hour)
  # Weekend boost: 1-6am UTC weekends
  - cron: "*/20 1-6 * * 6,0"  # 18 runs per weekend (6 hours × 3/hour)
```

### Regional Optimization Examples:
- **Singapore (ap-singapore-1):** Business hours 9am-6pm SGT = 1am-10am UTC
- **US East (us-east-1):** Business hours 9am-6pm EST = 2pm-11pm UTC
- **Europe (eu-frankfurt-1):** Business hours 9am-6pm CET = 8am-5pm UTC

### Intelligence Features:
- **Context awareness:** Knows if running during off-peak, peak, or weekend
- **Pattern learning:** Accumulates success data for optimization
- **Regional adaptation:** Auto-detects region and adjusts recommendations
- **Usage calculation:** Estimates monthly consumption and buffer remaining

## Updated Cost Analysis

| Metric | Basic | Enhanced | Improvement |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Daily runs | 45 | 42-60* | Adaptive |
| Monthly minutes | 1,350 | 1,068-1,440* | Dynamic |
| Free tier usage | 68% | 53-72%* | Optimized |
| Intelligence | None | Full analytics | ✅ Added |

# Validate all enhanced scripts
bash -n scripts/adaptive-scheduler.sh scripts/schedule-optimizer.sh

# Simulate pattern recording (requires GitHub CLI)
source scripts/utils.sh
record_success_pattern "test-ad" "1" "3"
record_failure_pattern "test-ad" "CAPACITY" "2" "3"
```
